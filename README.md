# MICROSOFT_TEAMS-CLONE
I have made a Microsoft teams clone nodeJS for backend, and webrtc(peerJS) for video streaming.
This is a project made under 'Microsoft Engage Program', under a time span of 25 days.



HOW TO CLONE THE REPOSITORY AND RUN THE CLONE APP ON VISUAL STUDIO CODE-

1) You need to install node, and npm.
2) You need to install express, socket.io, peer, uuid, git,nodemon
3) express-   npm install express
4) peer -  npm install peer
5) socket.io- npm install socket.io
6) uuid- npm install uuid

Now, after installing the above, go to the respective repository, and make sure to change the port of peer in script.js to 3030 from 443 to run it on localhost.
Run command ' nodemon server.js'

Go to google chrome or Microsoft edge, and type ' localhost:3030'
and the Clone would work.
